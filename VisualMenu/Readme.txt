My StreamDeck plugins for integrating with Daz Studio.
This requires you to run the Daz Studio plug-in by esemwy.  https://github.com/esemwy/StreamDeckSocket
I'm a noob programmer.  If you have suggestions, please let me know.
Thanks to esemwy for doing the heavy lifting in the Daz Studio c++ sdk. (https://github.com/esemwy)
Thanks to BarRaider for the development tools (https://github.com/BarRaider)
